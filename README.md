# ECSE 321 – Airline Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of **ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering** at McGill University.  
The scope is to build a **web-based airline system** that allows:
- Customers to sign up, browse, and book flights (with 5% overbooking, rewards, cancellation/refunds).  
- Pilots and flight attendants to view their assigned flights.  
- Booking managers to create, edit, cancel flights and assign crew.  
- The owner to manage employees, promotions/policies, and review statistics.  

All stakeholders interact with the system through a web frontend; persistence is handled by PostgreSQL with JPA/Hibernate.
